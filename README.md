# Long reads shotgun metagenomics of rice straw decomposition

This repository contains the scripts and workflows used to benchmark **MetaWGS**, **HiFi-MAG-Pipeline**, **LorBin**, and **SemiBin2** for contig-level binning of long-read metagenomic assemblies derived from PacBio HiFi datasets.

The study compares the performance of the four pipelines/binners in terms of genome completeness, contamination, and overall MAG quality. Quality assessment and benchmarking were performed using **MAGFlow**.
